# AI Agent Instructions

Universal instructions for AI coding agents working in this vault.

## Structure

```
[Pillar]/
├── Inbox/      # Quick captures
├── Projects/   # Active work
├── Knowledge/  # Reference (has MANIFEST.md)
```

## Routing

- Quick thought → `Inbox/`
- Active work → `Projects/`
- Reference → `Knowledge/`

## Rules

### Always
- Read MANIFEST.md before searching Knowledge/
- Update MANIFEST.md after modifying Knowledge/
- Use `[[Note Name]]` for links

### Ask First
- Which pillar if unclear
- Before deleting files
- Before major reorganisation

### Never
- Create files at vault root
- Commit without clear message

## Adding Pillars

Duplicate `Personal/` folder and rename. Scripts auto-detect pillars.
